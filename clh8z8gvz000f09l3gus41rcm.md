Nothing special here, just me testing out this blogging platform to assess its place to share [incredible thoughts](https://youtu.be/DSIaEziP8fA?t=38) on software development, 10x engineering, AI, bitcoin, and whatnot 🤷🏻‍♂️.

So far it looks promising, the focus is on the most important part of authoring: writing.

I tried WordPress.com first, mostly because I'm working at Automattic, but frankly I don't like it. Having to pay for simply adding custom CSS is a deal breaker for me, plus I spent too much time changing themes and layouts instead of writing. I couldn't find the motivation to do anything more than style my home and about page. See the dead blog here: [byovi.wordpress.com](https://byovi.wordpress.com/).

As you might have understood 🤔, I favor free speech over job security. Cool enough, Automattic is a company where people think out of echo chambers, which makes them pretty cool and fit for me. I couldn't work for any other type of company. Nor could I survive in communism, they would kill me too soon for my open mouth.

Until next time: *🙋🏻‍♂️ Carry on, but please don't shitcoin…*
