Nothing special here, just me testing out this blogging platform to assess its place to share [incredible thoughts](https://youtu.be/DSIaEziP8fA?t=38) on software development, 10x engineering, AI, bitcoin, and whatnot 🤷🏻‍♂️.

So far it looks promising, the focus is on the most important part of authoring: writing.

I tried [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com) first, mostly because I'm working at Automattic, but I was disappointed. I couldn't find the motivation to do anything more on that blog but to update my home page, to change the theme 10 times; yet I still ended up not happy with the choice 🤦🏻‍♂️. The dead blog is: [byovi.wordpress.com](https://byovi.wordpress.com/).

As you might have understood 🤔, I favor free speech over job security. Cool enough, Automattic is a company where people think out of echo chambers, which makes them pretty cool and fit for me. I couldn't work for any other type of company, nor could I survive in communism, they would kill me too early 😂.

Until next time: *🙋🏻‍♂️ Carry on, but please don't shitcoin…*
